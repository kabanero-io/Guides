<!-- # Creating and updating tasks and pipelines -->
## Intro
A default set of tasks and pipelines are provided that perform a variety of CI/CD functions.  These tasks and pipelines include validating the application stack is active on the cluster, building applications stacks using appsody, pushing the built image to an image repository, and deploying the application to the cluster. These tasks and pipelines operate with the default application stacks and operate as-is for new application stacks you might create. Also, there are cases where you can update the tasks or pipelines or create new ones. This guide explains the steps you follow to make updates to tasks or pipelines and how you can update your Kabanero CR to use your new pipeline release.

## Setting up a pipelines repo
{: #settingup}

1. Clone the [pipelines repository](https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-pipelines).
  
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-pipelines.git
   ```

1. Notice that the default pipelines and tasks are under the `pipelines/incubator` repository.

    ```shell
    cd pipelines/incubator
    ```
  
1. Edit the existing tasks, pipelines, or trigger files as needed or add your new tasks and pipelines here. To learn more about pipelines and creating new tasks, see [the pipeline tutorial](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md).

## Creating a pipelines release from your pipelines repo
{: #createrelease}

The product operator expects all the pipeline's artifacts to be packaged in an archive file. The archive file must include a manifest file that lists each file in the archive along with its sha256 hash. The kabanero-pipelines repo contains a set of artifacts under the `ci` directory that easily allows you to create and publish a release of your pipelines.  

### Creating the pipelines release artifacts locally 
{: #createartifacts}

You can build your pipeline repo locally and generate the necessary pipeline archive that is used in the Kabanero CR. The archive file can then be hosted in some place of your choosing and used in the Kabanero CR. To generate the archive file locally:

1. Run the following command from the root directory of your local copy of the pipelines repo:

    ```
    . ./ci/package.sh
    ```

2. Locate the archive file under the `ci/assets` directory.

3. Upload the archive file to your preferred hosting location and use the URL in the Kabanero CR as described in the next section.

### Creating the pipelines release artifacts from your public Github pipelines repo using Travis
{: #createfromgit}

If your pipelines are hosted on a public GitHub repo, you can set up a Travis build against a release of your pipelines repo, which generates the archive file and attaches it to your release. The kabanero-pipelines repo provides a sample `.travis.yml` file.

Use the location of the archive file under the release in the Kabanero CR as described in the next section. 

### Creating the pipelines release artifacts from your GHE pipelines repo using a pipeline on the OpenShift cluster
{: #createfromghe}

Use the following steps to trigger a pipeline build of your pipelines repository. The pipeline will build the pipelines and deploy a `pipelines-index` container into your cluster. The `pipelines-index` container will host the pipeline archive on an NGINX server.

1. Login to your OpenShift cluster.

1. Navigate to the `ci` directory of your pipelines repo.

1. Activate the pipeline.
    ```
    oc -n kabanero apply -f tekton/pipelines-build-pipeline.yaml 
    ```
1. Activate the task.
    ```
    oc -n kabanero apply -f tekton/pipelines-build-task.yaml 
    ```

1. Configure security constraints for service account `pipelines-index`
    ```
    oc -n kabanero adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z pipelines-index
    ```

1. Create the `pipelines-build-git-resource.yaml` file with the following contents. Modify `revision` and `url` properties as needed to point to your pipelines repository and the revision you want to build.

    ```
    apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: PipelineResource
    metadata:
      name: pipelines-build-git-resource
    spec:
      params:
      - name: revision
        value: master
      - name: url
        value: https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-pipelines.git
      type: git
    ```

1. Activate the `pipelines-build-git-resource.yaml` file.

    ```
    oc -n kabanero apply -f pipelines-build-git-resource.yaml
    ```
    
1. Create a `pipelines-build-pipeline-run.yaml` file with the following contents.

    ```
    apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: PipelineRun
    metadata:
      name: pipelines-build-pipeline-run
      namespace: kabanero
    spec:
      pipelineRef:
        name: pipelines-build-pipeline
      resources:
      - name: git-source
        resourceRef:
          name: pipelines-build-git-resource
      params:
        - name: deploymentSuffix
          value: latest
      serviceAccountName: pipelines-index
      timeout: 60m
    ```

1. [Create a secret](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/auth.md#basic-authentication-git) for your git account and associate it with the `pipelines-index` service account. For example:
    ```
    oc -n kabanero secrets link pipelines-index basic-user-pass
    ```

1. Trigger the pipeline.
    ```
    oc -n kabanero delete --ignore-not-found -f pipelines-build-pipeline-run.yaml
    sleep 5
    oc -n kabanero apply -f pipelines-build-pipeline-run.yaml
    ```

    You can track the pipeline execution in the Tekton dashboard or via CLI:
    ```
    oc -n kabanero logs $(oc -n kabanero get pod -o name -l tekton.dev/task=pipelines-build-task) --all-containers -f 
    ```

   When the build completes successfully, a `pipelines-index-latest` container is deployed into your cluster.

1. Get the route for the `pipelines-index-latest` pod.

    ```
    PIPELINES_URL=$(oc -n kabanero get route pipelines-index-latest --no-headers -o=jsonpath='https://{.status.ingress[0].host}/default-kabanero-pipelines.tar.gz')
    echo $PIPELINES_URL
    ```

1. Use the URL in the Kabanero CR as described in the next section.

### Updating the Kabanero CR to use the new release
{: #update}

Follow the [configuring a Kabanero CR instance](/docs/ref/general/configuration/kabanero-cr-config.html) documentation to configure or deploy a product instance with the pipeline archive URL obtained in the previous step. Then, generate the digest of the pipelines archive contained at this URL and specify it in the Kabanero CR. You can use a command like `sha256sum` to obtain the digest.

See the following example where the pipelines that are published in the `https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-pipelines/releases/download/0.6.0/default-kabanero-pipelines.tar.gz` archive are associated with each of the stacks that exist in the stack repository.

```
apiVersion: kabanero.io/v1alpha2
kind: Kabanero
metadata:
  name: kabanero
  namespace: kabanero
spec:
  version: "0.9.1"
  stacks:
    repositories:
    - name: central
      https:
        url: https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/releases/download/v0.9.0/kabanero-index.yaml
    pipelines:
    - id: default
      sha256: deb5162495e1fe60ab52632f0879f9c9b95e943066590574865138791cbe948f
      https:
        url: https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-pipelines/releases/download/0.9.1/default-kabanero-pipelines.tar.gz
```

As an alternative, you can specify the pipelines archive under individual stack sections. This configuration associates the pipelines in the archive with these application stacks.
